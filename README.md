# JobCode
JobCode is a software solution developed as part of the AWS + .NET challenge offered by Next Wave Education, within the .NET Expert mentorship program guided by mentor Luis Dev.

# About the Challenge

For this cloud developer project, I decided to develop a job search software using the main knowledge required by this challenge and Amazon Web Services as the main cloud resources.
